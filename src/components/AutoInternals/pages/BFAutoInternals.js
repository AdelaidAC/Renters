            <p className='text-center fw-bold mb-2'>This disclosure was prepared by California Insurance Commissioner: READ IT CAREFULLY!</p>
            
            <p className='lh-2 mb-0'>
                <b>I. </b>Do not sign any broker fee agreement unless all of its blank lines and spaces have been filled-in and you have read the entire document and the agreement carefully.
                <br />
                <b>II. </b>Your insurance broker represents you, the consumer, and is entitled to charge a broker fee if he/she chooses. This fee is not set by law, and may be negotiable
                between you and the broker.
                <br />
                <b>III. </b>It is illegal for an insurance broker to charge you a fee for placing coverage solely with the California Automobile Assigned Risk Plan or the California Fair Plan.
                Fees may be charged for placement of other coverage’s.
                <br />
                <b>IV. </b>Broker fees are often non-refundable even if you cancel your coverage. Refer to your broker fee agreement to see if your broker fee is non-refundable. However,
                you may be entitled to a full refund of a broker fee if your broker acted incompetently or dishonestly. Unresolved disputes over non-refunded broker fees can be
                forwarded to the Department of Insurance for review.
                <br />
                <b>V. </b>You are entitled to obtain and keep a completed copy of this disclosure and any broker fee agreement you sign.
                <br />
                <b>VI. </b>Your broker may receive a commission from insurance company(ies) for placing your insurance. This commission may be paid to your broker by the insurance
                company(ies) in addition to any broker fee you pay.
                <br />
                <b>VII. </b>If you will be paying your premium in installments to a finance company, by law you must receive a copy of a premium finance disclosure and agreement. Be
                sure to obtain and read those documents before signing a premium finance agreement. Also, ask the broker if the insurer offers its own installment payment plan.
                Insurer installment plans are often cheaper than premium financing through a separate premium finance company.
                <br />
                <b>VIII. </b>If your broker is placing automobile coverage; your broker must provide you with a copy of the current Department of Insurance pamphlet Automobile
                Insurance. If your broker is placing residential coverage, your broker must provide you with a copy of the current Department of Insurance pamphlet Residential
                Insurance. By signing this disclosure, you acknowledge receipt of the appropriate pamphlet(s).
