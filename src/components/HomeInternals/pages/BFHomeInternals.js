            <p className='mb-0'>
                <b>I. </b>Do not sign any broker fee agreement unless all of its blank lines and spaces have been filled-in and you have read the entire document and the agreement carefully.
                <br />
                <b>II. </b>Your insurance broker represents you, the consumer, and is entitled to charge a broker fee if he/she chooses. This fee is not set by law, and may be negotiable
                between you and the broker.
                <br />
                <b>III. </b>It is illegal for an insurance broker to charge you a fee for placing coverage solely with the California Automobile Assigned Risk Plan or the California Fair Plan.
                Fees may be charged for placement of other coverage’s.
                <br />
                <b>IV. </b>Broker fees are often non-refundable even if you cancel your coverage. Refer to your broker fee agreement to see if your broker fee is non-refundable. However,
                you may be entitled to a full refund of a broker fee if your broker acted incompetently or dishonestly. Unresolved disputes over non-refunded broker fees can be
                forwarded to the Department of Insurance for review.
                <br />
                <b>V. </b>You are entitled to obtain and keep a completed copy of this disclosure and any broker fee agreement you sign.
                <br />
                <b>VI. </b>Your broker may receive a commission from insurance company(ies) for placing your insurance. This commission may be paid to your broker by the insurance
                company(ies) in addition to any broker fee you pay.
                <br />
                <b>VII. </b>If you will be paying your premium in installments to a finance company, by law you must receive a copy of a premium finance disclosure and agreement. Be
                sure to obtain and read those documents before signing a premium finance agreement. Also, ask the broker if the insurer offers its own installment payment plan.
                Insurer installment plans are often cheaper than premium financing through a separate premium finance company.
                <br />
                <b>VIII. </b>If your broker is placing automobile coverage; your broker must provide you with a copy of the current Department of Insurance pamphlet Automobile
                Insurance. If your broker is placing residential coverage, your broker must provide you with a copy of the current Department of Insurance pamphlet Residential
                Insurance. By signing this disclosure, you acknowledge receipt of the appropriate pamphlet(s).

                Broker will only honor cancellation requests made in writing and signed by the Client. Broker may provide client with insurance identification cards upon completion
                of the applications process. Client acknowledges and understands that insurance coverage is not provided until the application is underwritten and accepted by the
                insurance company. Accordingly, the identification cards cannot be used as proof of the insurance by the Client until the insurance company has bound and issued
                coverage as evidenced by a declaration page and/or policy. Client understands that a "binder" number is not evidence of insurance under the declaration page is
                issued. Broker and Client agree to binding arbitration with ADR of any disputes in which the amount claimed exceeds the small Claims Court jurisdiction under the
                rules set up by the DR, in accordance with California Code of Civil Procedure, without right of appeal.
